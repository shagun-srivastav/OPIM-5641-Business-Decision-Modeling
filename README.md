OPIM 5641 Business Decision Modeling course project -‘Buy-and-Hold versus Momentum trading using Modern Portfolio Theory’

In this project, investment strategies for stocks based on Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and momentum trading (MT) is investigated. The stocks that have been selected are from the Consumer discretionary(Amazon, Nike, & Starbucks), Industrial(FedEx, Boeing & UPS) and  Technology(Apple, Microsoft & Qualcomm) sector. A portfolio of stocks that appropriately balances the conflicting risk and profit using MPT is created and compared using different investment strategies based on Momentum Trading.  

In MPT, the goal is to allocate money into stocks to maximize the expected return while accounting for your risk tolerance, which is measured by volatility. The Momentum trading strategy is based on the crossing points of the moving averages.Buy operations are triggered when the 9-day moving average becomes larger than the 21-day moving average, and sell operations are triggered when the 21-day moving average becomes larger than the 9-day moving average.
